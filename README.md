# Counting Words

A dead simple - ahem, over-engineered - program that will count words and give you 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 stats about them.

> **Disclaimer:** This is the first time for me even touching TypeScript in my life, but I have to admit it makes JS so much better. Since there is no official format for me to work with I just freeloaded it a bit.

> **Disclaimer:** I am not a designer, so do not expect a lot from me on that front.
